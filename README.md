# Beam-plasma-instability-in-the-presence-of-collisional-effects
Time evolution of the beam-plasma instability considering the full set of nonlinear effects for Langmuir, ion-sound and transverse waves, in the presence of binary collisions, collisional damping and electrostatic bremsstrahlung. For more details of the the plasma configuration, see Ini_bak.wt file.
